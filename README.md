## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

```css
.introduction {
 display: grid;
 grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
 gap: 32px;
}

Simple, right. After watching The Net Ninja CSS grid playlist, I learned that this 12 column is the standard layout for responsive design. So, why was I using 5 column? I couldn't tell you.
```

### Continued development

I didn’t just learn Grid. I learned how to debug, how to ask better questions, and how to rethink layout systems. That feeling when the layout finally clicked? Pure gold. If you’re learning CSS Grid, know this: it might not click right away. But when it does, it’s like turning on the lights in a dark room.

## Acknowledgments

- Linkedin - [Yacoub Al Dweik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaqoubdw/) - Thank you for responding to my Linkedin post and pointing me in the right direction, that direction being The Net Ninja. His masterclass onbuilding layouts using css grid was a lifesaver. Thank you!!


- Youtube - [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPuYbmmPdEM) - A massive thank you to Shaun for demystifying CSS Grid! I was at a standstill on this Front End Mentor project, finding Grid incredibly challenging. Your videos provided the practical knowledge and clear explanations I desperately needed. Your calming delivery made the learning process much smoother. After watching your content, I gained the confidence to refactor my code and successfully implement the Figma design. Thank you for helping me overcome this hurdle!
